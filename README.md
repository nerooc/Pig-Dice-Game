## Gameplay
Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold": If the player rolls a 1, their score gets wiped and it becomes the next player's turn. If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues. The game ends when one of the players reaches/crosses the established limit (set to 30 right now).
